### Dual RGB LED Blink (Arduino)

ALternatively blinks red, green, and blue LED bulbs, along with the same color RGB.

### Emergency Car Alert

Have hurry for office? feeling sleepy? fear to sleep in the car? No Worry! Strange right? It is quiet XD !!! As u move closer to a car, or a wall, this alert engine in ur car will sense u getting closer, and it will make noises, and vibrate, to wake u up! The closer u move, the wider is the voice, to wake u up!
It is indeed useful!

### Ultrasonic Vehicle Distance Indicator

It is an ultrasonic Arduino distance indicator that uses a single RGB LED to alert or indicate a driver getting close to another vehicle on the road. It uses the Red-yellow-green traffic light format to suggest your action.

### Automatic Air-Cooler Controller

A very simple design of a circuit that automatically starts the motor of an Air Cooler when the temperature rises above 27 deg. C and switches it off once it goes down! This will help save lots of electrical energy and reduce pollution caused by all-time running ACs.

### Automatic Water-Pump (Arduino Zero-Radiation Edition)

It is a new tilt-based water pump controller. The tilt sensor is to be attached to a fulcrum-floating rod, like in a cistern. This will automatically switch on the pump when the water level reduces and switches it off once the tank gets filled!

### Heating Alert

This alert-based sensor will ring the buzzer once the ambient temperature of the sensor grown more than 50 degrees Celcius. This can be very useful to detect unexpected or harmful temperature increase in circuit equipment and chemical apparatus.
